## Project Overview:
China is a vibrant developing country, with its overall economic size now ranking second in the world, only behind the United States. Economic development cannot be achieved without the impetus of science and technology, and scientific progress is inseparable from investment in education. This study utilizes data from the "Scientific Research Budget of Prefecture-level Cities in China" published by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and tables created from the educational expenditure reports of various cities within each province released by the provincial education departments. These data are further analyzed in terms of both time and space. Python is used in this study to perform a series of data organization, error correction, and analysis, combined with visualization from multiple perspectives. Finally, the study produces a spatial distribution map of provincial education expenditures, making the data more intuitively visible.
